# Decoding-Baseball-A-Data-Analysis-Journey

# Overview

This project explores the rich world of Major League Baseball (MLB) through data analysis and visualization. Utilizing historical data from Retrosheet, this project aims to provide a deeper understanding of player performance and game context, highlighting how situational factors influence outcomes in baseball.

# Objectives

Database Development: Build a MongoDB database to store and manage detailed play-by-play data from Retrosheet event files. The database is designed to facilitate efficient querying and comprehensive analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct thorough EDA to extract insights related to player performance and game dynamics. This includes defining baseball "eras" and creating context-informed metrics to evaluate player contributions.

Data Visualization: Develop visualizations to effectively communicate key findings, focusing on how game context affects player decisions and overall team performance. This aims to make complex data accessible and engaging for baseball enthusiasts.

# Key Features

MongoDB Implementation: Successfully parsed event files to create a flexible JSON format suitable for MongoDB, enhancing data accessibility and analysis capabilities.

Insightful Analytics: Identified trends and patterns in player performance, emphasizing the importance of context in understanding game outcomes.

Interactive Visuals: Created various visual representations of data, helping to illustrate complex relationships and insights drawn from the analysis.
Future Work

Context-Informed Player Metrics: Develop metrics that assess player performance based on game context, allowing for a nuanced understanding of player contributions.

Comparative Analysis: Explore the impact of offensive versus defensive plays on team success and overall game outcomes.

Historical Exploration: Investigate 19th-century baseball data to uncover characteristics of early baseball eras and their influence on the modern game.
